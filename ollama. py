CW Status Automation – Process Overview

Purpose

The automation streamlines handling of user status in CW by moving through different systems and performing the required actions automatically.

Start – User Status in CW

When a user is active in CW → Provide the SSO URL.

When a user is inactive in CW → Move forward to JEDS for validation.


JEDS Validation

If the user is active in JEDS → The system waits 2–3 days for CW to update.

If CW becomes active → Provide SSO URL.

If CW remains inactive → Move forward to the feed file.


If the user is inactive or outdated in JEDS → Notify the user to request their manager to update JEDS.


Feed File Validation

If the user is active in the feed file → An automated email is sent to the Vendor UL team.

If the user is inactive in the feed file → Proceed to HR Data Hub.


HR Data Hub Validation

If the user is active in HR Data Hub → No action is required, the update will flow through.

If the user is inactive in HR Data Hub → A TRIP request is created automatically to enable the account from the admin side.


Benefits of Automation

Removes repetitive manual work.

Automatically escalates to the right team.

Provides timely communication to users and teams.

Reduces dependency on manual tracking.


Final Outcome

Each user is guided through a structured path until their account is either:

Enabled with SSO access,

Escalated to Vendor UL or admin teams, or

Advised to update details through their manager.
